== Changelog 0.9.7 ==

=== new features ===
*   We're now using a separate configuration file.
*   Basic installation script added after complains.
*   Basic installation script for the modules is also added.

=== bug fixes ===
*   One nasty bug in &favlist - $playlistdir.$playlist instead of
... "$playlistdir/$playlist".
*   Spelling failure in the help text.

== Changelog 0.9.6 ==

=== bug fixes ===
*   pimpd -play 5 didn't return the fifth track to STDOUT, but the track that
... was playing just before that.

== Changelog 0.9.5 ==

==== new features ====
*   When some output spans over 80 columns, we'll truncate it from now on. 
... There is a reason why !badware do it like this.
*   Implemented lyrics support. The idea and how to do it is shamelessy stolen
... from ncmpcpp's source.
*   &information() - Mark if the bitrate is low.

==== bug fixes ====
*   &show_playlist() -  When calling subroutines directly from GetOptions,
... GetOptions will pass the (stringified) name of the function to the 
... function itself. Because of this, we'll get something like 'show_playlist'
... when we shift of values from @_. Naturally, this is not what we want.
... Therefore, I've implemented some basic sanity checks.
*   While rewriting, I noticed that some variables could possibly return undef
... if the tags are missing - fixed.

==== other  ====
*   Completely rewritten. Got rid of some ugly pieces of code.
*   &show_playlist() - reworked the output to follow standard rules of maximum
... 80 columns. I removed the album from the output since having all three
... fields sharing 80 columns would make it almost unreadable.
*   Changelog no longer maintained in the code, as you can see. :)
*   A lot of cleanup is done regarding variables. Why declare variables holding
... the same value in almost every function... stupidity.
*   &polling is now named &monitor for consistency.
*   $APPLICATION_NAME, $APPLICATION_VERSION introduced, mainly so that I can
... see what version I'm actually working on at the moment... :)

== Changelog 0.8.5 ==

=== new features ===
*   &show_playlist - allow listing of the current playlist
*   &play - function for choosing track number to play

==== bug fixes ====
*   &randomize - We were actually adding $count-1 tracks, oops.

== Changelog 0.8.1 ==

=== new features ===
*   &polling() - rewrite of the scrobbling function. Whenever song changes,
... filename is presented on STDOUT.
*   &favlist() - let user choose name of playlist.

=== other ===
*   &similar_artists() - removed. It sucked.

== Changelog 0.7.3 ===

=== new features ===
*   &bighelp() - introduced, using Pod::Usage.
*   &randomize() - let user choose how many tracks to add.
*   &cp2port() - introducing support for remote file transfers using Net::SCP
... or the scp binary. (thanks <zibri>at<ethup.se>)

== Changelog 0.7.0 ===

=== new features ===
*   &cp2port() - support for copying the track to user supplied destination.
... What was I thinking hardcoding it? :/
*   &scrobbling() - introducing local scrobbling that'll turn into statistics
... later on.

== Changelog 0.6.0 ===

=== new features ===
*   Switched from Getopt::Std to Getopt::Long. Thank god for that.
*   Removed unneccesary 'features' - if no argument is supplied to
... &similar_artists() and &list_playlists(), just show the user what
... there is to choose from. No need for separate functions, got damn it.

== Changelog 0.5.0 ==

=== new features ===
*   &add_playlist() - introducing. 

=== bug fixes ===
*   check if the copy function from &cp2port() actually returns true or not.

== Changelog 0.4.0 ==

=== other ===
*   Switched from parsing the MPD db by hand to $mpd->collection->all_pathes
*   &randomize() - The homemade randomize function seldom worked and was ugly.
... Now we're using the shuffle() function from List::Util.
