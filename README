pimpd is an MPD client written in perl that strives to implement the features
mpc is missing. This includes, but is not limited to:

·  Regular expression based database queries
·  Regular expression based searches in active playlist
·  Randomizing of playlist; you could add 100 (carefully!) randomly selected
   tracks to your playlist
·  Fetching of lyrics on demand
·  Queue functionality
·  Interactive shell for basic MPD operations
·  Monitoring of MPD - Whenever a song change takes place, pimpd announces
·  Ability to easily copy current track to specified location; i.e your portable  
   musicplayer of choice or maybe to your to-burn directory
·  Huge load of interesting information regarding what's currently spinning

Please see below for a full list of options.
